# Changelog

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-06

- Browse existing HomeBase recordings by date from each camera card and play a selected clip in HA.
- Use verified calendar query 10006; camera-scoped, expiring references prevent arbitrary path downloads.
- Authenticated HA proxy with entity permissions, bounded in-memory MP4 preparation and cancellation on navigation.
- Preserve the unpublished WebRTC/audio functionality and idle battery safeguards.
- Recover idle sessions stranded by a missing live-stop event through bounded HomeBase transport closure; distinguish active viewers, pending stops and recording failures in the UI.

- On-demand WebRTC H.264 video and listen-only Opus audio through HA-managed go2rtc.
- Muted autoplay with an explicit sound toggle; native camera dialogs remain snapshot-only.
- Ephemeral media grants cannot start or renew a camera; browser-painted frames renew the existing local viewer lease.
- Real Chromium, FFmpeg and go2rtc tests cover audio/video, close, navigation and frozen playback.
- Live validation confirmed four camera entities/snapshots, 1920×1080 WebRTC video and existing HomeBase 3 recording playback in HA.
- Requires HA go2rtc and browser-to-HA media connectivity. Wider model coverage, physical audio output, iOS suspension, remote routes and complete history pagination remain unverified.

Upgrade both the bridge and HACS integration, restart HA, update the existing card resource to `?v=0.2.0` and reload the dashboard. See the README for the upgrade steps.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-05

Initial public release for HACS custom-repository installation.

- UI configuration, account verification/reauthentication, battery sensors and redacted diagnostics.
- Bundled visual-editor camera card: snapshots at rest, live video only after a tap.
- Shared viewers, immediate stop on close, independent bridge watchdog and a two-minute session cap.
- Home Assistant OS bridge app and standalone Docker build, with pinned Node dependencies.
- English/Dutch translations; Home Assistant 2026.9.0 baseline.
- Four cameras reported working in the first installation; instrumented start/close confirmation for one camera.

Live video is JPEG-based, up to 8 fps / 960 pixels wide, without audio. iOS suspension, power-loss behavior, long-term battery impact and broad model compatibility remain unverified. See the validation record.
